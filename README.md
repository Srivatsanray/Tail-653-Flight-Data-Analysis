# Tail-653-Flight-Data-Analysis
## Description:

In this repository, we have tail 653 flight's data for analysis for the detection of anamolies in the aircraft engine to help with aircraft maintenance.

Our Tail 653 aircraft is represented by 8 flights, each a zip file. Each zip file contains about 650 individual matlab files. 

The names of the matlab files use a naming convention. The file names are fixed length can be parsed by the number of characters. For example, if a file is named “652200101092009.mat”, then:

* 652 = tail ID

* 2001 = year

* 01 = month

* 09 = day

* 20 = hour

* 09 = min
